Cyber Guardian – Advanced Antivirus and Cybersecurity Solution
Cyber Guardian is the next-generation antivirus and cybersecurity suite designed by DarkSpace Software & Security and developed by Michael Blenkinsop. In today’s fast-paced digital world, where cyber threats evolve constantly, Cyber Guardian provides multi-layered protection to safeguard your company's data and infrastructure while streamlining security operations. Its competitive pricing and robust features make it the ideal solution for businesses of every size.

Key Features and Benefits
1. Comprehensive File Protection & Real-Time Monitoring
Real-Time Protection:
Cyber Guardian continuously monitors a user-selected directory—preferably a folder like Documents or Downloads—for any unauthorized changes. With its real‑time protection toggle, any file modifications are immediately detected and logged on the Threat Map, giving you prompt visibility into potential security incidents.

Threat Map:
The intuitive Threat Map displays the time, source, threat type, and a detailed description of each detected event. This visual overview allows you to quickly assess and address threats, ensuring your company’s critical data remains secure.

User-Friendly Directory Selection:
When enabling real‑time protection, the tool prompts you to choose a folder where you store your personal or business-critical files. Selecting a user folder helps reduce permission errors that occur when scanning system directories.

2. Advanced Antivirus Scanning
Flexible Scan Controls:
Cyber Guardian offers comprehensive scanning options, including:

Start, Pause, Resume, and Stop:
Easily initiate a scan, pause it when needed, resume a paused scan, or stop it entirely—all with a single click.
Ransomware Protection:
Activate a dedicated ransomware protection mode that flags files exhibiting ransomware-like behavior (for example, filenames containing “encrypt”). This targeted approach minimizes the risk of a ransomware attack.
Threat Detection and Response:
Detected threats are presented in a detailed Threats table. For each file flagged as a threat, you can choose to:

Remove: Permanently delete the file.
Quarantine: Isolate the file by moving it to a secure quarantine folder.
Shred: Securely delete the file by overwriting its contents multiple times (via the safe delete file shredder), ensuring that sensitive data cannot be recovered.
3. Integrated VirusTotal Connectivity
Cyber Guardian is connected to the VirusTotal API, which cross-references suspicious IP addresses and files against a global database of malware signatures and threat indicators. This integration adds an extra layer of verification to your threat detection efforts. While the free VirusTotal API is subject to rate limits (which may result in occasional “429” errors), the connectivity ensures that you have access to up-to-date threat intelligence—and you can upgrade to a premium API key for higher throughput if needed.

4. Robust Network Monitoring & Active Service Management
Real-Time Network Logging:
Cyber Guardian logs all incoming and outgoing network activity in real time. This helps you quickly identify and respond to unusual network behavior.

Active Network Services:
The system displays a table of active processes with network connections, including details such as PID, process name, and the number of connections. A handy “Kill” button lets you immediately terminate any process that appears suspicious.

5. Configurable Firewall and Intrusion Detection (IDS)
Customizable Firewall Rules:
Cyber Guardian lets you add both predefined and custom firewall rules through an intuitive interface. You can easily add rules from a provided list, enter your own custom rules, and remove any rule you no longer need with a simple “Remove Selected Rule” function.

Integrated IDS:
The built-in Intrusion Detection System continuously monitors processes and network connections for signs of malicious activity. If any process behaves suspiciously, you’ll receive an immediate alert, enabling rapid response.

6. Safe Browsing and VPN Integration
Safe Browsing Mode:
Toggle safe browsing to protect your company’s online activities from phishing and other web-based threats.

VPN Control:
With integrated VPN controls, you can quickly enable or disable VPN connectivity. This feature adds an extra layer of privacy and security to your network communications.

7. Modern, User-Friendly Interface
Intuitive and Clean GUI:
Cyber Guardian boasts a modern, organized interface with detailed tool tips on every control. Whether you’re managing real‑time protection, scanning files, or monitoring your network, the clear guidance makes it accessible to all users.

Customizable Themes:
Choose between Dark Mode and Light Mode to match your preferences or align with your company’s branding.
